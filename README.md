These are not all necessary for the software to run but will provide some functionality you may or may not want. Wlogut will give a power button that you can click in waybar that brings up a menu for logout, lock, reboot, etc. You can edit waybar config to remove this if you'd like. Also you can pick something other than gnome and gtk for the xdg desktop portal such as kde.\

These are not entirely necessary but will make fixing your config easier:\
nwg-look - easy to customize gtk settings such as font, cursor


Probably you will have to edit configs to fit your setup. Dont need to use zsh or starship for anything.
