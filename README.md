pipewire or pipewire-pulse for pavucontrol maybe better to just use the pipewire version from git instead of pavucontrol because pulse is old

not entirely necessary but msot of the configs are using one of these because I am a fool? Not sure how fonts are done on hyprland as I was using KDE previously before reinstall, will update if i fix it to just use system fonts istead of having to specify in each config file
